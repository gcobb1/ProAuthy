# ProAuthy
A User Authentification System Application that can be used to authenticate users by Username and Password. Passwords may be recovered and reset based on authentification questions. Users data is retrieved efficiently using different algorithms based on the size of Database. This Backend, with adjustments, is used to service authentification on my other projects. Test out a few options and create an account while on any device!
